# Action_Button
====
This is how to use the Button to control your character and the response to hold it down.

## Description
This project registers Events to a Button so that it can be manipulated, and adds a long press function to the Button.

## Usage
Add an EventTrigger to the Button.
You can register Events by adding bodywalk.cs to the object you want to manipulate.
The object can be moved by both the single press of the button and the long press of the button.
